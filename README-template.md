## Overview
Actually I must agree it's a pretty interesting challenge and has helped me measure my growth, months before now I don't think I could write good codes as this or I was knowledgeable ... To everyone out there just keep pushing and learning , learn key concepts ... don't memorise codes.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it


## My process
So I started out with mobile first, and yeah I made mistake, I didn't make a proper planning before delving into coding,  I think proper planning is an aspect I have to look into now as it will help mitigate the tendency of encountering acute problems that can seriously drain your mental health.
So after the design of mobile , I began the scripting because I was too excited to start using the Jquery.
Afterwards I started the design for the Desktop before encountering the lightbox problem.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Jquery](https://Jquery.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learnt a whole lot about Jquery, it's really a write less and achieve more with your code, This project will be the first time I will be making use of Jquery to build a site. It made things a lot easier, even though it doesn't look neat, I was evolving over the hours I spent writing each line of Jquery Code I kept on finding better ways of doing things.. for example writing a function to display block if it's on none when I can simply use the `.hide() and show()`
Though I still find the light box here to pose a problem.kindly help out if you can.
Also I noticed CDN fails sometimes and the thing got me frustrated...a whole lot of times as it will mess up my code and I will start trying to debug until I eventually found out that the CDN fails to connect sometimes. So I wrote a function that executes when the CDN fail...so that I don't get frustrated and can easily pin point the problem

```
I will say I am proud of the Jquery the most  
```

### Continued development
I will say my Jquery , then yeah probably the concept of lightbox



### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - I can't even make mention  of how  much w3schools helped me enough.
